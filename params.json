{"name":"Slim Node","tagline":"A NodeJS Blogging engine, using flat files and Markdown","body":"What is SlimNode\r\n========\r\nSlim Node is a blog engine that makes use of Markdown flat files as a blogging engine, making it easy to update and edit, without having to worry about having a chunky CMS like wordpress or Drupal to manage your content. It is quick and light and the entire application logic (not including node dependencies) is only 56kb in size.\r\n\r\nIt is based off of [SlimBlog](http://davidsivocha.github.com/slimblog), which is a Flat File PHP Blogging system. \r\n\r\nYou can use Git to push updates to the articles folder, making it easy to update.\r\n\r\nHow to use\r\n========\r\nTo install, copy to your server and run `npm install` to ensure that the dependencies are installed. Then run `node app.js` to start your blog.\r\n\r\nBlog articles need to be saved to the Articles folder. The application reads the contents of the folder and the files to generate lists and data for the application. They use the format as shown below.\r\n\r\n\t{\r\n\t   \"title\" : \"Article Title\",\r\n\t   \"date\"  : \"2012/02/15\",\r\n\t   \"slug\"  : \"first-article\",\r\n\t   \"author\": \"Author name\"\r\n\t}\r\n\t\r\n\tLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod\r\n\ttempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam,\r\n\tquis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo\r\n\tconsequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse\r\n\tcillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non\r\n\tproident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.\r\n\r\nYou can add as much data as you want into the JSON field data at the top. Feel free to make your own extensions using the data that you provide.\r\nCurrently the only _required_ fields are the `title`, `date` and `slug` fields. Articles should be saved using the date combined with the slug. So if you call the article `A guide to blogging online` and you give it the slug `blogging-online` and the date as `2012/02/15` you should save it as `2012-02-15-blogging-online.txt`. \r\n\r\nThe `date` field should be formatted as `YYYY/MM/DD`.\r\n\r\nThe slugs are identifiers to point at the file.\r\n\r\nAdditional notes:\r\n========\r\nThe blog articles should be constructed in Markdown. This provides formatting. \r\nIf you want to include images in your articles upload them to the `public/images` folder. To link to them use `![Alt Text](/image/yourimage.jpg \"Optional title\")` \r\n\r\nOther than that, enjoy. If you have any issues or need any help raise an issue!\r\n\r\nTemplating\r\n========\r\nTemplates are all controlled by [jade](http://jade-lang.com/) and there are 4 Main files for you to worry about.\r\n- `layout.jade` - This controls the main layout of the page and the stylesheets and JS includes\r\n- `index.jade` - This is the article list page\r\n- `article.jade` - This is a page that displays the articles\r\n- `about.jade` - This is a static page that is used for the about. \r\n\r\nUrl Structure\r\n========\r\n- `/` - This routes to the full list\r\n- `/blog` - This routes to the full list\r\n- `/blog/:year` - This displays an archive listing by year\r\n- `/blog/:year/:month` - This displays an archive listing by month\r\n- `/blog/:year/:month/:day` - This displays an archive listing by day\r\n- `/blog/:year/:month/:day/:article` - This is the permalink structure to an article\r\n- `/page/:page` - This is a link to a static page\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SlimNode\r\n========\r\nInpsired by an article on [NetTuts](http://net.tutsplus.com) for a static file blog in PHP, I thought to myself \"that would be way more badass in node\". This is the result.\r\nThis repo is maintained by @davidsivocha. [Sivocha.com](http://sivocha.com)/[ThreeHive](http://threehive.co.uk).\r\n","google":"UA-43986260-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
